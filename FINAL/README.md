Created new blog site using HTML, CSS, and JS with GSAP plugins.

Uses GSAP to create typewriter animation, landing shrink animation, and horizontal scroll animation.

Uses CSS flexbox to organize divs for horizontal scroll.

Uses HTML to structure site.

Things to do for 5/8:
-adding pages for entries
-updating images & possibly fonts
-smooth scroll to make animations feel less clunky
